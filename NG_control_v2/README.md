# Fast Neutron Generator Monitoring and Control system v2

Note that NG_control_app (which is version 1) is just displaying the data and allows for no control.

This version of the control system controls the deuterium mass flow meter and the solid state microwave generator.

Maybe at a later point the readouts of the database (High voltage, current, dose) can also be included.
